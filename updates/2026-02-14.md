## Diary — 2026-02-14

They may never be received or read.
Or simply be thrown away.
Happy Valentine’s Day. Though I’m not sure what exactly there is to celebrate.

Since February 1st, 2026, I have been building this website.
Creating and deleting.
Repeating too many times.
I went to the temple today and had noodles. For the first time, I even added some side dishes. 
The noodles were all broken. I gathered some courage and went back to ask for more. 
I also spent some time petting the little cats at the temple, but one of them scratched me.

Now I want to leave them here,
quietly preserved in this corner of cyberspace.
I made a wish. I wished that one day my friend would come back, or become rich. 
I’m not sure whether the Buddha understands English.

I finally stopped crying this week.
Yet somehow, I am crying again.
On my way back, I saw an orange cat. It seems to always stay around that area. I played with it.
I hope everyone can meet a kitten or a person who truly loves them.

Will anyone find here someday?
I also bought some chocolate. 
I don’t even really like chocolate anymore, but lately I’ve kept wanting to eat it. 
Maybe I’m still a little sad. I’m not sure.

I hope everyone gets to be loved.

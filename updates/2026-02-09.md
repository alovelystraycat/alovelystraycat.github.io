# 2026-02-09 Update

After deleting and revising it over and over again,
I finally decided on this version.

It is far from perfect,
but I am still trying, still searching, still figuring things out.

## Diary — 2026-02-06

They may never be received or read.
Or simply be thrown away.

Since February 1st, 2026, I have been building this website.
Creating and deleting.
Repeating too many times.

Now I want to leave them here,
quietly preserved in this corner of cyberspace.

I finally stopped crying this week.
Yet somehow, I am crying again.

Will anyone find here someday?
